# To_Do_App
To-Do list application which uses Cloud FireStore to store the data.
Data can be added, Realtime updated, Deleted.
The database can be viewed in the Firebase console.
Worked with some third-party libraries for UI design.
Built the list using Recycler View. Used Card View Class for Frame Layout.

Third party libraries are
  * MaterialEditText-2.1.4
  * Spots progress dialog.
  
Appreciate the team for library development.

## To Do
Make it more vivid by adding more colors.
